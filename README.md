## Contribute

Contributions are welcome in the Wikimedia Foundation Gerrit system that actually (2020) is the questionable recommended system by the Wikimedia Foundation.

This should allow some kind of questionable openness in contributions to this project. Anyway Gerrit has questionable intuitiveness, so, good luck:

In case of panic look at the commit history and contact one of the latest contributors to talk about how to contribute.

Note that actually a commit does not auto-magically land in production.
